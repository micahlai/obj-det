'DetMetrics' object has no attribute 'curves_results'. See valid attributes below.

    This class is a utility class for computing detection metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision
    (mAP) of an object detection model.

    Args:
        save_dir (Path): A path to the directory where the output plots will be saved. Defaults to current directory.
        plot (bool): A flag that indicates whether to plot precision-recall curves for each class. Defaults to False.
        on_plot (func): An optional callback to pass plots path and data when they are rendered. Defaults to None.
        names (tuple of str): A tuple of strings that represents the names of the classes. Defaults to an empty tuple.

    Attributes:
        save_dir (Path): A path to the directory where the output plots will be saved.
        plot (bool): A flag that indicates whether to plot the precision-recall curves for each class.
        on_plot (func): An optional callback to pass plots path and data when they are rendered.
        names (tuple of str): A tuple of strings that represents the names of the classes.
        box (Metric): An instance of the Metric class for storing the results of the detection metrics.
        speed (dict): A dictionary for storing the execution time of different parts of the detection process.

    Methods:
        process(tp, conf, pred_cls, target_cls): Updates the metric results with the latest batch of predictions.
        keys: Returns a list of keys for accessing the computed detection metrics.
        mean_results: Returns a list of mean values for the computed detection metrics.
        class_result(i): Returns a list of values for the computed detection metrics for a specific class.
        maps: Returns a dictionary of mean average precision (mAP) values for different IoU thresholds.
        fitness: Computes the fitness score based on the computed detection metrics.
        ap_class_index: Returns a list of class indices sorted by their average precision (AP) values.
        results_dict: Returns a dictionary that maps detection metric keys to their computed values.
