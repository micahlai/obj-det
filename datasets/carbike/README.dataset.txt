Here are a few use cases for this project:

1. Traffic Monitoring Systems: The Car-Bike Detection model can be used to monitor and analyze traffic flow in real-time. It could count the number of bikes, cars, scooters, and motorbikes on the road and provide insights to traffic management officials for optimizing traffic regulations.

2. Smart Parking Solutions: This model can be integrated into a smart parking system to identify and allocate appropriate parking spots based on the type of vehicle entering the parking lot (car, bike, scooter, or motorbike).

3. Road Safety Applications: The model can be utilized to study patterns of road usage and potentially unsafe behaviors or conditions, such as detecting when there are too many bikes or scooters in an area primarily intended for cars, or vice versa.

4. Autonomous Driving Technology: The Car-Bike detection model could be an essential component in building autonomous driving systems, helping to distinguish between different types of vehicle in the vicinity.

5. Urban Planning and Infrastructure Development: By using the model to analyze traffic patterns, urban planners can make more informed decisions on infrastructure development, such as the need for more bike lanes or car-only lanes.
