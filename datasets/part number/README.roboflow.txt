The dataset includes 457 images.
Number are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 300x300 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via adaptive equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -22 and +22 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.36 percent of pixels
