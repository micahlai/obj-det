# Resistor Detection

## Overview

The purpose of the resistor detection dataset is to provide training and test data for an object detection model able to classify simple circuit components on a breadboard. 

The end vision is a mobile application where the user takes a picture of their breadboard and the circuit is then automatically simulated. The results of the simulation will inform the user as to whether the circuit constructed is safe, fully connected, and devoid of shorts.
