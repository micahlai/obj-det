## Background Information
This dataset was curated and annotated by [Ilyes Talbi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyes-talbi-ba2451135/), Head of [La revue IA](https://larevueia.fr/), a French publication focused on stories of machine learning applications.

Main objetive is to identify if soccer (futbol) players, the referree and the soccer ball (futbol).

The original custom dataset *(v1)* is composed of 163 images.
* Class 0 = players
* Class 1 = referree
* Class 2 = soccer ball (or futbol)

The dataset is available under the Public License.
